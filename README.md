# STM32 HAL libraries
Set of useful high quality libraries to make interaction with various hardware / modules / etc simple.

## List of libraries
- [LoRa library](https://github.com/belyalov/stm32-hal-libraries/blob/master/doc/lora.md) (for devices based on `SX1276` chip), **does not** implements LoRaWAN.
- [SI7021 temperature/humidity](https://github.com/belyalov/stm32-hal-libraries/blob/master/doc/si7021.md) high precision I2C sensor.

## Usage
- Super simple way: just copy required files into your STM32 HAL project.. that's it!
- [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
